# Password_Genie #TesterTenders
My main file for the project is testertenders. Every other file is what helped me get there.
*Still in progress*
Originally created this project to brush up on some python and to have fun. I thought of the idea for python to create a randomly generated password that could possibly print the password 
to a text document or somewhere I could document the data and the password. This will be a work in progress until the top of the document is changed to *finished*. Any help and suggestions 
would be appreciated on this project. Discord: DMGNAO#9935 - twitter: FN_Nao_

Repo made 8/24/23 in my critical thinking class
I was bored.
